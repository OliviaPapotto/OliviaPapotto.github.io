    <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In college, I took a management class titled Business Analysis. This class focused on the systems development life cycle and alternative methodologies. In this class, the professor focused a lot on the earlier phases such as planning and specification of structured requirements along with methods, techniques, and tools to determine requirements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the things my professor focused on most during the course was the importance of documentation in projects and their processes. I remember being fascinated by the Standard Operating Procedure document we had to create for the business processes we were analyzing at the time and being surprised at the detail of the document. This taught me the importance of SOP documents and how they are an important part of any business.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When creating the foundation for this mock SOP, I wanted to ensure I understood every element that makes a SOP more than just a step-by-step guide. To do this, I read other SOP guides that are to industry standard and noted the main categories I wanted to focus on for Cat Corporation. To make sure the reader, in this case a HR employee, gathered all of the information needed, I chose a process that I am only familiar with on one side as the interviewee. By choosing this, I was able to research more into the topic to understand how the process should be conveyed to someone who needs to learn every part of the procedure. This is emphasized by using a glossary to detail terms that someone who may not be familiar with HR concepts can easily understand. Moving along there are the responsibilities and procedure categories. These needed to be more detailed as they are the 'meat' of this scenario. However, since these two sections are the longest section of the document, they also need to be organized properly. I chose a bullet points format for the Responsibilities to neatly organize the content and since the order of this content does not matter. Next the procedure section of the document details the hiring process in a step-by-step way that tells the user what each segment of the hiring process should look like. I chose to use a bold font on the steps of each part and italicize the topic to show its importance. The last three sections I included were a Supporting Documentation, Revision History, and Approval section. These sections are important in SOP documents because they detail to the user where to find additional information, along with who in the company may have been responsible for originally creating the document if issues arise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Next, I created the purpose and scope with a simplistic theme in mind as these categories are meant to give the user a brief glimpse as to what they will be learning, and their respective role.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lastly we have the physical design of the document. I chose to create a simple header along with a fake logo to represent the Cat Corporation branding that exists. Since this is a SOP document, it is important to have brand choices present to represent the company.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In Conclusion, I believe Standard Operating Procedure documents are an important part of technical writing because they encapsulate the importance of design and content for a business. It is important to understand the processes when working with a company to ensure as a writer I understand the technical aspects along with portions users need to know as well.</p>
