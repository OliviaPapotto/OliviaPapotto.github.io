    <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This project was for my technical writing class in school. The task at hand was to design a brochure for any topic that we chose. I thought what better topic than local Clemson, South Carolina. In order for the brochure to be effective, it needed to be concise and directed towards its intended audience while also appealing. Since brochures are used to market something, it needs to have facts along with images that make it visually appealing in a creative way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first task at hand was identifying the customer. The customer in this case is someone who is interested in traveling and someone who may not know too much about the town. In order to understand what individuals look for when traveling, I researched other vacation/travel sites to see what they prioritized showing a user. From there I was able to understand the key features of traveling and what to highlight about Clemson.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to note that most individuals will only think of the football team when they hear Clemson, so it is important to highlight the town of Clemson and how it is separate from the university. After identifying the user, I was then able to pivot my research into key features of the town and what is potentially attractive to an outside audience. Because Clemson as a town has a lot more to offer than football and college, I wanted to emphasize the other aspects that make it special as much as I could while still highlighting the colors that cover the town.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p>As stated, I wanted orange and purple to be the main theme of the brochure because they are the main colors that represent the city and not just the football team. Next, I wanted images that captured the natural beauty of the area so I incorporated two nature-themed images that I took on various hikes. The last image that is used is one that is an homage to football, one I took after the football team beat Syracuse in 2018 that also encapsulated the main colors in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving on to the data presented, I chose to highlight four main categories: Football, Nature, Disc Golf, and Food. As a college student, I believed those are some of the most important aspects of the city. Something to watch, something to engage in, something to do, and something to eat! After determining those categories, I did some research to determine the most important aspects of these categories so I could keep them as brief as possible. Overall, there is much more to Clemson than these four categories, but in a brief brochure, I believe they are some of the most important ones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Next, I wanted to include a few brief slogans that would stay with the user so they could remember the most important parts of the town. Aside from being a college town, there are many things to do and explore. Lastly, I thought it would be important to include directions to Clemson and contact information for the fictitious company I made to represent the Clemson travel agency.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Overall, I found this project to be very engaging and something that taught me a lot about design and content. It is important to know what the audience is so that one can capture their attention and give them the information they are looking for.</p>
