    <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In my first job post college, I worked for a telecommunications company. In my time at this company, I learned the value of Knowledge Base articles for end-users. KB articles are an important piece to any business where there is a product for customers as these articles tend to be the bridge between the sellers and buyers. Since technology is a relatively new phenomenon to our society, it has not yet gotten to the point where it is accessible to all individuals. Having well-written knowledge base articles is one small step a company can make to ensure that its product is easy to use for all. Having KB articles in one place also provides a cohesive environment for users whose time matters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of my career and something I hope to bring to my future employers is the importance of accessibility in technology.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On another hand, having an effective KB system in place also allows for companies to have cost-effective support. This means that instead of technical support having to help individuals on small tasks, they can use the KB as a line of 'first defense' to try to solve an issue. This reduces the overall workload of technical support staff and empowers users to be more independent.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another notable feature of KB articles and systems is that they provide consistency to a product. When there is a single well-known source for information, it helps maintain uniformity to avoid conflicting information. This also helps in creating a solid environment for training and onboarding newly employed individuals in a company. They provide a structured environment where anyone can go to learn more about products, processes, and best practices for a system.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When creating this brief KB article, I wanted to highlight the features of what makes successful articles. Firstly, clear and concise titles make it easier for a user to find the topic they need. This can be assisted with tags or links to denote similiar similar that can help navigate users to the right place, but still keep the article clutter-free. Next, there needs to be a well-organized structure to the article. This is shown using numbered bullet points to create a coherent organization that is easy for a user to follow along.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then I also want to highlight the importance of note boxes. These are important to users because they highlight potential things that could interfere with their ability to solve a problem. For example in this scenario, conference calling may not be available on all phone plans, thus it is something important the user should be aware of beforehand. Overall, having a consistent use of fonts that are easy to read and colors is important for a brand and its users.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lastly I wanted to include a feedback mechanism that would provide a way for users to give feedback on a topic. This allows for support staff to see that there may be an issue with a certain article and provide it the attention it needs whether it is in need of an update or missing information.</p>
        <br>    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Knowledge Base articles are an important part in the technical industry to help bridge the gap between developers and the customer. Being able to create a successful KB system requires a solid understanding of the product and strong writing skills for documentation. This is especially true in telecommunications where there may be multiple ways to accomplish one task. Overall, this was a fun scenario to put together and a good way to combine multiple technical writing skills.</p>
